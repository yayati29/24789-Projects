Implemetation of neural netwrok framework with numpy.


Structure: 
activations.py contains the activation class, with sigmoid, tanh and identity activation functions.

criterion.py contains the SoftmaxCrossEntropy class to calculate loss.

perceptron.py contrains the Neural network architecture.

main.py contains the main function, it calls all the above classes

To Run:

extract data.zip (containing mnist_train, mnist_test csv files) in the parent folder.

Go to main.py make changes as needed in the main functions as needed.

Run
